(1) Modify the 2nd line of the sample params.ini to 
[the path to the QEDynamics4comp folder]/QEDynamics4comp/DiracData/STO-3G

(2) Then, 
$ ./sim params.ini

(3) You should get "out.dat" file under QEDynamics4comp.
You may plot the 4th row (charge density at (x,y,z)=(-1,0,0), 
difference from the initial value) against 2nd row (time).
